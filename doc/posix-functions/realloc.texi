Gnulib module: realloc-posix

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:

@itemize
@item
Upon failure, the function does not set @code{errno} to @code{ENOMEM} on
some platforms:
mingw, MSVC 14.

@item
On some platforms, @code{realloc (p, n)} can succeed even if @code{n}
exceeds @code{PTRDIFF_MAX}.  Although this behavior is arguably
allowed by POSIX it can lead to behavior not defined by POSIX later,
so @code{realloc-posix} does not allow going over the limit.
@end itemize

Without the @samp{realloc-gnu} module described below, it is not portable
to call @code{realloc} with a size of 0.  With a
null pointer argument, this is the same ambiguity as @code{malloc (0)}
on whether a unique zero-size memory region is created.

Behavior is a real mess for @code{realloc (p, 0)} with non-null @code{p}.
C23 says behavior is undefined.
C17 says it is implementation-defined whether @code{realloc}
returns a null pointer or a pointer to a new zero-sized memory region.
C89 through C11 say @code{realloc} returns a null pointer.
No standard says whether @code{errno} is preserved when
@code{realloc} successfully returns a null pointer.
In practice, platforms have one of the following behaviors:

@enumerate
@item
Always free @code{p}, without changing @code{errno} and return a null pointer:
(glibc 2.1.1--2.40, most likely glibc 2.41+ at least by default, Android).

@item
Always free @code{p}, possibly set @code{errno}, and return a null pointer:
(AIX, mingw, MSVC).

@item
Always free @code{p} without changing @code{errno}
and then return a pointer to a new region of size zero:
(glibc 1--2.1, perhaps glibc 2.41+ in some configurations).

@item
When successful free @code{p}, possibly set @code{errno},
and then return a pointer to a new region of size zero;
when unsuccessful do not free @code{p}, set @code{errno},
and return a null pointer:
(musl libc, macOS, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, Cygwin).
@end enumerate

@noindent
A program not suspecting these variations in semantics will either:

@itemize
@item
Leak memory (the still-valid @code{p}),
if it assumes behavior (1) or (2) but the system implements (3) or (4).

@item
Falsely respond to memory exhaustion (if it checks for realloc failure,
as it should) or have double-free bugs (if it does not check),
if it assumes behavior (3) or (4) but the system implements (1) or (2).
@end itemize

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:

@itemize
@item
When not growing an already-allocated region, i.e.,
when @code{p} points to a region of size @code{psize} and @code{n <= psize},
the standards allow @code{realloc (p, n)} to fail and return a null pointer.
It is not known which, if any, implementations actually fail in this situation.
@end itemize

Extension: Gnulib provides a module @samp{realloc-gnu} that substitutes a
@code{realloc} implementation that behaves more like the current
glibc implementation.
It fixes these portability problems:

@itemize
@item
@code{realloc (NULL, 0)} returns @code{NULL} on success on some platforms:
AIX 7.3.

@item
On some platforms, @code{realloc (p, 0)} with non-null @code{p}
might not free @code{p}, or might clobber @code{errno},
or might not return @code{NULL}.
@end itemize
