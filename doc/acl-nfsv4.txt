General introduction:
   https://linux.die.net/man/5/nfs4_acl

The NFSv4 acls are defined in RFC7530 and as such, every NFSv4 server supporting ACLs
will support this kind of ACLs (note the difference from POSIX draft ACLs)

The ACLs can be obtained via the nfsv4-acl-tools, i.e.

$ nfs4_getfacl <file>

# file: <file>
A::OWNER@:rwaDxtTnNcCy
A::GROUP@:rwaDxtTnNcy
A::EVERYONE@:rwaDxtTnNcy

Gnulib is aiming to only provide a basic support of these, i.e. recognize trivial
and non-trivial ACLs
