Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
This header file is missing on some platforms:
MSVC 14.

@item
Although many systems define a @code{struct dirent} member named
@code{d_type} and directory entry type macros like @code{DT_DIR} and
@code{DT_LINK}, some do not:
AIX 7.2, HP-UX 11, Solaris 11, probably others.

@item
On systems with @code{d_type}, not every filesystem supports
@code{d_type}, and those lacking support will set it to @code{DT_UNKNOWN}.

@item
Some systems define a @code{struct dirent} member named @code{d_namlen}
containing the string length of @code{d_name}, but others do not.

@item
Some systems define a @code{struct dirent} member named @code{d_off}
containing a magic cookie suitable as an argument to @code{seekdir},
but others do not.

@item
Some systems define a @code{struct dirent} member named
@code{d_reclen} containing the number of bytes in the directory entry
record, but others do not.  This member has limited utility, as it is
an implementation detail.
