Gnulib module: utmp

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
This header file is missing on some platforms:
FreeBSD 13.0, mingw, MSVC 14.
@item
@code{<sys/types.h>} is a prerequisite of @code{<utmp.h>} on some platforms:
FreeBSD 8.0, OpenBSD 7.2.

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
On some platforms, this API does not support timestamps past the
year 2038:
glibc 2.38 on 32-bit platforms like x86 and ARM where @code{time_t}
was historically 32 bits.
@item
On some platforms, this header misbehaves if the @code{year2038} or
@code{year2038-recommended} modules are used and the program is
configured without the @option{--disable-year2038} option.
The @code{readutmp} module works around this problem:
glibc 2.38 on 32-bit platforms like x86 and ARM where @code{time_t}
was historically 32 bits.
