Makefile.am:
# The value of top_builddir, determined by Autoconf and stored in the Makefile,
# consists of n times '..', where n is the depth of the $(srcdir) under
# $(top_srcdir). Here we need one more '..', because the test framework
# (init.sh) arranges to run the tests in a subdirectory of depth 1 under the
# directory where the Makefile sits.
